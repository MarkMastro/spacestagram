A demonstration app for the Shopify Frontend Internship program


## Introduction

For the purposes of this project, Shopify is extending our mission to Make Commerce Better for Everyone to include the whole entire universe. Please build us an app to help share photos from one of NASAâ€™s image APIs.

The live version of the app is available at www.markmastropaolo.com

### Technology

This app was created in React and styled components.
React was chosen to take advantage of the reusibility of components such as the results and display items. Using react with reusable components also makes it simpler to control the flow of the project as well as styling the components themselves. 

### Features

* Infinite scrolling
* UI similar to Instagram
* Random feed from Astronomy Picture of the Day on the Home page
* Like/unlike functionality saved to localStorage and accessed on Likes page
* Displays a loading state as feedback to the user when pictures are loading

### Future Features
As I continue to add projects to my portofolio I will be add more features to this project including:
* Date selector to see pictures posted between dates
* Comment section
* Sharing
* Mars Rover feed 
* Refining to make it more accessible with Lighthouse reports
