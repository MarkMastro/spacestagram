# Spacestagran

A demonstration app for the Shopify Frontend Internship program


## Introduction

For the purposes of this project, Shopify is extending our mission to Make Commerce Better for Everyone to include the whole entire universe. Please build us an app to help share photos from one of NASAâ€™s image APIs.

The live version of the app is available at www.markmastropaolo.com

### Technology

This app was created in React and styled components.
React was chosen to take advantage of the reusibility of components such as the results and display items. Using react with reusable components also makes it simpler to control the flow of the project as well as styling the components themselves. 

### Features

* Infinite scrolling
* UI similar to Instagram!
